    <span style="color: Yellow;">A House on Fire  </span>
 <p>   Fire is the force and factor which as greatly contributed to the development of the human civilization. It has helped man in many ways. It helps him to run factories, cook food and keep his home warm. It is man`s enemy also. It destroys houses, shops and lives. It is both a blessing and a curse </p>
<p>Last night, I was lying fast asleep. A noise suddenly woke me up. I opened the window of my room. I climbed upstairs and saw many people running towards one direction. They were carrying buckets full of water. I climbed downstairs and came out from my house. I found that one house of our neighbor had caught fire.</p> 
<p>The owner of the house and all members of his family were standing in the street. They were standing as a helpless lot. The people were trying to pull out their household things. They were throwing water and sand on fire. They were trying to control the fire in every possible way. The flames were rising higher and higher. In the mean-while the fire-brigade reached there. The firemen fought bravely and brought the fire under control in a few minutes.</p> 
<p>Fortunately there was no loss of life but there was a big loss of property. All the furniture was reduced to ashes. The doors and windows of the house were burnt. No food, no clothes could be saved. All the neighbors came forward to the rescue of the family. They contributed substantially for the relief of the family. Later on it was found that the cause of fire was short-circuit. But after a few days, the family went to the insurance company. The insurance company gave them the insurance. </p>

    <article>
 <p>There are several means of transport. We can travel by car, by bus or by train. Journey by train is considered to be safest. It also gives us an exciting experience. In the train we come across different people belonging to different corners of the country. We get so intimated to them that we feel sad when we apart from them. The journey by train is a thrilling experience. </p> 
    <p>Last week I happened to visit Delhi by a train. We were invited there to attend a marriage. I gleefully decided to attend the marriage. I got my seat booked in the superfast. We reached the station well in time. The train had not come yet. There was a heavy rush at a platform. Then a sound it was the sound of the train the train had arrived. Since our seats were booked we had no difficulty in boarding the train. </p>
    <p>After sometime the train started. At first it was slow but soon it gathered speed. Soon the passengers occupied their seats, set their luggage and everything settled down. In my compartment, there were passengers who belong to different states of the country. Soon they became friendly with each another. They talked about their states. They discussed various aspect of their life. Then they began to play cards. They shared the food of one-another. </p>
    <p>I was sitting near the window. I saw green field and farmers working on them. The trees and electric poles seemed running behind. Meanwhile some beggars entered our compartment. They were blind. All gave them a piece or two. The waiters of train canteen were bringing tea, coffee and other drinks. Time passed on so quickly that we did not know when we reached Delhi. My uncle had come to the Delhi station to receive us. We went with him by his car. In this way the journey by a train was a very pleasant journey experience for me. </p>

Some carry luggage to carry on their heads to place it on the roof of the bus. There is a great noise all around. The sound of bus-horns makes the scene noisier. A kind of confusion prevails there. If the seats are numbered in the bus, it is well, otherwise the passengers rush to occupy a seat of their choice. </p>
 <p>If it is a bus-stand of a big city, the bus stops there for a longer than the normal time. After the time of stoppage is over, the conductors blow a whistle to attract the passengers.

    <article>
 <p>Cinema is a cheap resource of amusement. People love to visit it quite often. Students are especially fond of it. In order to see a movie, they can even miss their classes. I am not a film fan but whenever I happen to move past a cinema hall I find an interesting scene in front of it. </p>
 <p> People are standing in the queues before the ticket windows. Each waits for his turn patiently. Sometime when there is some new movie, there is a heavy rush of people. There is no queue at all where people are not standing. There is jostling and elbowing all around. It is free for all. There are some policemen, of course. They stand there as helpless spectators. Pick-pockets also become active. There are black-marketers who are selling tickets at much higher rate. </p>
 <p> People are also seen standing in groups. They belong to different sections of the society. They come in their best dresses. They are discussing different movies, stars and aspects of the movies. Some are standing before the tea-stalls sipping all types of drinks. People keep coming till the movie has started. The rich people come in cars, some people on rickshaws while others on foot. The horns of the vehicles keep attacking the ears. </p>
 <p>At the gate of the hall there is a ticket-checker. There are pictures of different scenes of the movies are being shown. These pictures are displayed just outside the box-office at the back of the hall. From the faces of the people it looks like they have no worry in life.

Their heart begins to be sinking as the moments draw near. They enter the hall the hall like terrified kittens </p>

I have also faced a numberless sleepless nights. But there is one particular night which I can`t forget in my whole life. It was the month of June. One evening it was almost close. There was no whiff of air. To add to our woes, suddenly the electricity went out. The fans stopped. It was difficult to lie in bed. Our electricity backup [inverter] was down.</p>
 <p>I kept tossing in the bed. The mosquitoes began to bite. In the scorching heat, it was difficult to cover the body with a sheet. Sleep was out of question. I had neither have net nor mosquito repellent. I had to use hand fan but there was no relief. The throat was getting dry every now and then, I drank liters of water. Little children were crying in the neighborhood because of intense of heat. Their jarring cries made me uneasy. </p>
 <p>Everybody was feeling like a fish out of water. There was no sign of electric current. The people were constantly phoning the electricity complaint centre. A major fault in the electricity supply was reported. The heat was tortuous. I went to bathroom and took bath twice. I came out and began stoolling in the lawn. Time was passing very slowly. Thus, I had to spend a sleepless night. </p>

   <span style="Color: Yellow" >An Accident</span>
   <article>
 <p>Accidents are very common these days. We daily read about them in newspapers. They result in the loss of many precious lives. They are caused by a number of factors. Careless and rash driving is the main cause of accidents. Ignorance of traffic rules and craze of speed also cause accidents. Sometimes the drivers cause accidents when they drive buses under the influence of liquor. </p>
 <p>Last month, my uncle invited me to Delhi. I was supposed to reach there early next-morning. No train was available at that time. I  decided to catch night bus. The bus was nearby full. Some passengers were taking dinner. Others were talking. Still others were dozing. The driver was driving the bus carefully. We reached Ambala Cantt at about 2 a.m.</p>
 <p>The bus was running smoothly. It had gone only a few kilometers from Ambala Cantt. There was hardly any light on the road sides. A truck was coming from the opposite direction. It had no head-lights. The driver of the bus could not notice it. There was a loud bang. The bus had met an accident. </p>
 <p>As a result of the accident, the window panes were broken. The passenger shrieked for help. The bus driver and the passenger of the front seat were injured. It was a horrible scene. Two of the passengers were seriously injured. They were immediately rushed to the hospital. Luckily I had received no injury. The people of the neighboring areas gathered there. They helped the passengers in every possible way. I caught yet another bus and reached Delhi in the morning.</p>

    <span style="Color: Yellow" >An Indian Beggar</span>
    <article>
 <p>Begging is a very common practice in India. One finds beggars here, there and everywhere. They besmear their faces with ash. They put on rags. They hold begging bowls in their hands. They produce painful cries as if they were really in deep trouble. Whenever any passer-by happens to pass, they try to extract a rupee or two from him. </p>
 <p>Beggars choose places of vintage for begging. They are seen in large number near religious places. Some go from door to door for begging alms. They are also seen at the railway-stations and bus-stands. They will not leave you until you part with some money. They will follow you wherever you go. Sometimes it becomes a problem to get rid of them. </p>
 <p>Beggars are both genuine and fake. But most of the beggars are false. They become beggars because they are shirkers. They don`t want to work. Begging is an easy way of making money. Some people have made begging their business. They are parasite on the society. They are burden on the economy of the country. </p>
 <p>Beggars are not self-respecting persons. Most of the beggars cheat. They commit crimes. They commit thefts. In order to evade arrest, they conceal their identity by becoming beggars. Some beggars are gamblers and drunkards. Whatever money they collect by begging during daytime, they spend it on drinking and gambling at night. </p>
 <p>Begging is a curse. It is a blot on the fair name of our country. The government should take steps to abolish it. It should open poor-houses. The disabled persons should be given free food and free clothes. The able-bodied beggars should be made to work. </p>

    <span style="Color: Yellow" >An Indian Porter</span>
    <article>
 <p>A porter is an important person of the society. He is seen at railway stations and bus stands. He carries the luggage of passengers on his back and shoulder from one place to another. He renders his services in all types of weather. Whether it is rain or shine he is always at his work. He earns his livelihood with the sweat of his brow. </p>
 <p>A porter wears a red uniform at the station and a Yellow uniform at the bus-stand. He ties his badge number on his arm. His charges for carrying luggage are fixed. But sometimes he over-charges the passengers. Sometimes he is rude in his behavior. He has no fixed income. As soon as the train steams in, he rushes towards the train compartments. </p>
 <p>A porter knows no rest. He has to work during day time as well as at night. Whenever any train is due to arrive, he becomes alert. He hardly gets any time to go home. Most of the time, he sleeps on the benches of the railway platform. In free time, he likes to smoke and play cards with his fellow porters. </p>
 <p>A porter is very helpful to passengers. He knows the timings of the trains. He also knows which train will arrive at which platform. He guides passengers in little matters. When the train stops he is the first to enter the compartment. He occupies the vacant seats by placing the luggage of his passengers there. He charges his fare after his passengers have counted their articles of luggage. We should be sympathetic towards him. </p>

 <article>
 <p>A hospital is a place where are brought for treatment. It is a place of pain and suffering. Nobody visits it with a smile. But circumstances compel us to visit it. Last month I chanced to visit the local civil hospital. I went to enquire the health of my friend who was admitted there. He had met with an accident and was getting treatment there. </p>
 <p>When I reached the hospital, there was a stinking smell in its compound. The sanitary condition was not satisfactory. Used syringes and blood-stained bandages were lying in different corners. I went to patient ward. He was not there. I had to enquire about the room allotted to him. I was told he was in a private room. I was told he was in a private room. My friend was greatly pleased to see me. </p>
 <p>My friend was being attended by his parents. His brother and sister were also there. I consoled them saying that joy and sorrow are the parts of our life unexpected things happen. Accidents also take place. But we should not be dishearten us. We should face them with strength and courage. I tried to cheer up with my friend. I had carried some fruit for him. He was very thankful to me. </p>
 <p>I met the doctor and asked him about my friend`s well-being. He was soft spoken. He told me that my friend was recovering fast. He informed me that my friend would be discharged in a day or two. I spent an hour with my friend. Meanwhile two nurses came there. They were in their uniform.  One of them checked my friend`s temperature. The second nurse gave him the medicine. I wish my friend a speedy recovery. Leaving him in a good mood, I returned home. </p>

 <span style="Color: Yellow" >A River in flood</span>
 <article>
 <p>Floods, earth quakes and famines are natural calamities. Whenever they strike, they cause a big havoc. There is a heavy loss of property and life. Some years ago, there were heavy rain falls in Punjab. Jalander was most affected area. The river Sultej was flowing above the danger mark. The nearby villages were submerged in water. People climbed up the roofs of their houses. The household goods were swept away by the swift current of the river. </p>
 <p>There was water everywhere. The little birds and cattle were floating on the surface of the water. Here and there some dead bodies could also be seen. All the roads were blocked, there was nothing to eat or drink. The supply of vegetables and milk was badly affected. The conditions began to worsen with the passage of each-day. The government had to act promptly. It sent helicopters to throw food packets to the stranded village. </p>
 <p>Many houses collapsed. Traffic was dislocated. Crops were destroyed. The low lying areas were totally submerged in water. Many electric poles were uprooted. The supply of electricity was badly affected. A dozen of persons were drowned in water at several places. The situation was getting out of control. The army had to be pressed in service. The rains stopped after full one week. The people heaved a sigh of relief. </p>
 <p>A number of measures had to be taken to combat the after-effects of rains. Relief parties were sent to different directions. The stranded people were brought to safe places. Medicines were distributed to check the outbreak of diseases. Loans were given to those whose crops were destroyed. Many social organizations came forward to help in the rescue operation. </p>

 <span style="Color: Yellow" >Charity</span>

 <article>
 <p>Charity is a noble virtue. A man of charitable nature is a true lover of mankind. To help out a person who is distress is a divine quality. There is incalculable amount of suffering in the world. Millions of people don`t get square meal a day. Those who roll in richness should help those who live in want and misery. To relieve suffering or hunger gives a person true joy. </p>
 <p>Charity can be shown in many ways. If a beggar stands at our door for alms, we should give him what we can easily square. Before parting money to him, it should be ensured that his needs are genuine. Otherwise the spirit of charity must be misused. Sometimes the need of charity is more urgent. Whenever there is some natural calamity like an earthquake or a flood, it becomes imperative for all to donate money generously.</p>
 <p>Charity should not be shown without distinction. If every beggar receives charity, the number of idles will grow. Instead of using limbs, they would hold begging bowls and stand in every nook and corner. There are some people who are unduly charitable. The able-bodied beggars thrive on their gifts. They don`t find it necessary to find a job to make their living. It is advisable therefore to make donations to charitable institutions. </p>
 <p>Charity should be shown secretly. It is not used to give publicity to oneself. There are people who try to gain high standards in a society by giving donations. There should be no selfish-motive behind an act of Charity. It is a duty of all of us to charitable in this world of untold sufferings. </p>

    <article>
 <p>Cinema is an important part of modern age. It has a cheap means of entertainment and education. It has a far-reaching impact on the society. It attracts all types of people. Young and old, men and women, rich and poor all love to visit cinema shows. Students are especially fond of it. </p>
 <p>Cinema influences young minds in many ways. The young people learn fashion from actor or actresses. They walk, talk and act like them. They become fans particular film starts. They learn popular tunes and dance at tea-parties. They see movies of their favorite hero or heroine several times. They don`t mind even missing their classes. They imitate dress-design and hair-style of film stars. Cinema has changed the youth into dreamers. </p>
 <p>Cinema has positive side also. It has social and moral values. It depicts social-problems and gives us valuable information about them. It creates awareness among citizens against social evils. There are many domestic movies which promote peace and harmony among families. There are movies based on historical events and personalities. They enlighten us about our history and strengthen our patriotic feelings. </p>
 <p>There is nothing good or bad about cinema. It depends on the producers and film-makers to make it good or bad. It is sad that they do not understand their social responsibility. Their main motive seems to be to make money. For the sake of money they can sacrifice their ideals and principles. The censor board should see that only good movies are made. </p>

    <span style="Color: Yellow" >Co-Education</span>
    <article>
 <p>Co-Education is one of the developments of the 20th century. It enables two sexes to meet, learn and understand each other. They receive their lesson jointly. They play together in the grounds. They go on educational tours together. They get real opportunities to understand each other. When free contacts between the sexes are allowed, many of their psychological problems are solved. </p>
 <p>Co-Education enables the two sexes to each other`s habits, hobbies and ways of thinking. A knowledge of other`s psychological is helped to a better understanding. Though marriage is not in the syllabus yet Co-Education indirectly prepares the student for the difficult test of marriage. This mutual understanding makes man realize the needs to give woman an equal status in social life. Co-Education gives man first-hand knowledge of the abilities of the woman. </p>
 <p>Co-Education has a refining effect on boys. Boys generally have the tendency to include in vulgar talk and indecent jokes. The presence of a girl among boys acts as a restraint on boys. They should be very careful while speaking. They should not use abusive languages. Rather they behave in a gentlemanly way. Co-Education also produces a spirit of competition between the boys and girls. Each sex tries to surpass each other. </p>
 <p>Co-Education is not without its drawbacks. In the first place, men find it difficult to concentrate on studies in the presence of women. Second, the needs of women are from those of men. Therefore they can`t given exactly same type of education. It would be a waste of effort to admit boys and girls with the type of syllabus. As long as social conditions do not change, Co-Education will not get encouragement. </p>

 <p>Cricket is one of the popular games of today. More and more countries are getting attached to it. In cricket, two matches are played. One is called test match which is played for five days. The other is a limited over match. A test match is not as exciting as a limited over match. Therefore people like to watch limited over matches.</p>
 <p>Last week I went witness to limited over match. It was played between India and Pakistan at ferozeshah ground. The match started exactly at 9’00 AM. The Indian captain won the toss but decided to field first. The openers of Pakistani team gave a solid start to their team. They scored 70 runs for the loss of one wicket in 12 overs. When the Indian captain introduced spinners, the things changed dramatically. They claimed four important wickets by conceding fifty runs in fifteen overs. The full team was for 192 runs in just 46 overs.</p>
 <p>After lunch, the match started again. The Indian openers were cheaply out. There were 80 runs on score board with six players back to pavilion. The fifth and sixth players played the cautious game. They scored 150 runs in forty overs. Six players were over by then. The task looked difficult. The Pakistani bowlers were bowling with accurate line and length. The tail – Enders of India played with maturity. They overtook the score of 192 with two wickets in hand. Thus India finally succeeded in defeating Pakistan.</p>
 <p>At the end of the match, there was a prize – giving ceremony. The chairman of India cricket control board was present on the occasion. He gave away the trophy to the Indian captain. The man of the match award was also given to the Indian captain for having played a glorious knock of 64. The match was really very interesting and absorbing.</p>

   <span style="Color: Yellow">Corruption in Public Life</span>
   <article>
 <p>Corruption is full swing in our country. It has polluted public life. Money has become a power source in life. Everybody wants to become rich overnight. We can`t get any work without greasing the palm. Right from peon to high officials, all are corrupt. A petty clerk in a government enjoys more power than a successful common man. There is no department which is untouched by corruption. </p>
 <p>The major factor that is responsible for widespread corruption is our political system. In order to keep his political base intact, a politician shields corrupt people. He has no regard for the law of land. He overlooks the evil practices of these people. If some honest office initiates any action against them, he is checked by political bosses. Many smugglers, black-marketers, hoarders and tax-evaders enjoy political patronage. They are the hand and glove of the corrupt politicians. </p>
 <p>Our defection economic system also breeds corruption. Faulty economic policies have led to heavy price-rise. It has become very difficult for a fixed income group to live up to certain standard. On the other hand corrupt people live in palatial bungalows and lead a life of luxury and plenty. The common people can`t resist the temptation of money. As a result they begin to make easy money through unfair means. </p>
 <p>Corruption will have to be abolished at all levels. For that matter our social setup will have to be changed thoroughly. Honesty should be encouraged as well as rewarded. Corrupt people should be punished and socially boycotted. Moral and human values be received and strengthened. Corrupt politicians should be shown their worth. They should be voted out of power and thrown into the dustbin. </p>

 <p>Examination is a calamity. Students are afraid of it. They tremble at the mention of its very name. Their face turns pale. They grow nervous. The entire smile on their face disappears. As soon it comes near, their condition becomes pitiable. The day before examination is horrible for them. </p>
 <p>On the eve of examination, they look worried and anxious. They are busy in revising all those questions which they have learnt for the examination purpose. They forget to eat food. They don t want to waste time on eating and drinking. TV programs cease to interest them. They try to cram some important questions. They more they learn, the more they forget. </p>
 <p>The students study till late mid-night. They try to keep themselves awake somehow. Even in sleep they are haunted by the fear of examination. They feel confused and upset. Even, after learning a lot many questions, they don t develop self-confident. They feel quite blank. They fear that the answers leant by them have started mixing up. </p>
 <p>The fear of examination hangs so heavy on their minds that they seek God s help. They pray to god to ward off this calamity. Some even try to buy god s blessing by making fabulous offers. They keep the photographs of Gods and Goddesses in their books and purses.</p>
 <p>There are students who unfair means in the examination. They are busy in making slips with the answer s scribbled with them. Some try to know supervisory staff in order to make acquaintance with them. Their purpose is to copy in the examination in connivance with the invilators. Thus, examination encourages the tendency of using unfair means. </p>

 <p>Examinations are necessary evil. They are mean to test ability of a student. Nobody welcomes them with a smile. Everybody is afraid of them. The every mention of examination sends a wave shiver in the body. As soon as they come near, students forget their food and rest. Examinations have advantages and disadvantages. </p>
 <p>Examinations test the knowledge of students. Students attend their classes for a full year. Teachers teach them various subjects. At the end of the year, it becomes imperative to test how much students have grasped these subjects. Examinations are the only yardstick to measure the ability of students. It is examinations which make students study books and learn things. If there is no examination, there will be no seriousness about the studies among the students.</p>
 <p>Examinations are also a curse. They take away the usual cheerfulness of students. They strike a kind of fear in their hearts. Near examination they grow nervous. They heave cold sighs. Some even go mad and some even catch fear. Examinations are not a true test of one`s ability. They are very slippery. Moreover examinations encourage cramming and copying. </p>
 <p>Examinations are not about advantages and disadvantages. They do not suit our present system of education. They should not overhauled. They should be more scientific and less frightening. We should follow the pattern of developed countries. </p>

 <p>Air pollution is caused by poisonous gases. The factories produce smoke. Smoke contains particles of carbon. These particles pollute the air.

They hijack buses and kill the people mercilessly. They kidnap men, women and children and demand a huge ransom for their release. They also hijack airplanes and make our life gloomy and risky.</p>
 <p>Terrorism must be checked at all costs. Public opinion should be formed against it. All the peace loving countries should unite and a wage a war against it.

   <article>
 <p>Democracy is the most popular form of government in the world. It is generally defines as the government of people, for the people and by the people. It ensures social justice, economic quality and political liberty. India adopted democracy in 1947. It has been functioning normally for some years. But now people have developed doubts about it. There are certain drawbacks in it. </p>
 <p>The first drawback is that the people of India are mostly illiterate. They have no knowledge of the working of the democracy. They are totally ignorant of their duties. They are carried away by false promises and catchy slogans. They are very poor. Political freedom has no meaning for them. Food is deader to them than their vote. Anybody who gives them food or money can buy their votes. </p>
 <p>India is a land of castes, religious and languages. They can`t tolerate one another. They keep quarreling over trifles. Communal riots are very common. These riots are blot on India`s democracy. The India leaders are corrupt and dishonest. They lack sincerity. Their main is to remain in power. They have destroyed democratic institutions o suits their needs. All democratic principles have been set aside. </p>
 <p>The people of India are dissatisfied lot. They are not happy over the way democracy is functioning here. They find fault in it. In fact the fault lies not with democracy but with us. If it can work successfully in England and America, why not in India then? Only we should remove its drawbacks. The future of democracy is bright in India. It may take time. </p>

   <span style="Color: Yellow">Future of English in India</span>
   <article>
 <p>English was introduced in India by the Britishers. They had a selfish motive behind it. They required petty clerks to run their administration. By giving workable knowledge of English to the Indians, they aimed at producing clerks. Now when India has achieved freedom, priorities have also undergone a change. They continuation of English has become a controversial subject. </p>
 <p>On one hand there are those people who say that English should continue as before. They are of the view that English is the language which created consciousness among Indians and united them against the British rulers. Without English national integration was not possible. They further express the view that English is an international language. Without it we shall be no better than the frog of a well. Moreover higher education is possible in English only. English opens our doors to the west. As such the votaries of English want it to continue as before. </p>
 <p>On the other side there are people who oppose English language. They argue that English is a foreign language. It is a symbol of slavery. Since the English have left India English must also go. It checks the spread and growth of Indian languages. They advance the view that each free country in the world has its own national language. Therefore Hindi should get the place of English. </p>
 <p>There should be no quarrel in the name of language. English should be retained in the interest of the country. The three-language formula is the best solution. Every Indian should learn his mother tongue right in the beginning. He should learn Hindi as a national language. English should be learnt as a link language. The future of English is thus as bright as ever before. </p>

The young people take hints of the new dresses from them. The tailors are also instrumental in giving new designs of suits. Besides fashions in dress, there are other fashions also. To visit clubs is a fashion with the people of upper classes. Sometimes they display interest in different arts although they may not have their basic knowledge. </p>
 <p>Fashions are futile. They add to our outward beauty only. The real beauty of a person lies in his character. Simple living and high thinking should be motto of our life. </p>

   <span style="Color: Yellow">Good Manners</span>
   <article>
 <p>Good manners make a man. They are essential to move in a civilized society. A man with good manners is respected everywhere. Good manners make our daily life smooth and sweet. ‘Please’ and ‘Thank you’ are small words but they have a good effect. They cost nothing but they are of great value. Ill- manners poison the stream of social life. </p>
 <p>Children learn good manners in the family. They are not taught outside the house. Children become what we make them. It is in the family that they learn how to talk and conduct towards others. If the parents keep quarrelling in the family, they can`t expect their children to be polite and soft spoken. Where there is no mutual love and respect in a family, it will be too much to expect them of children. </p>
 <p>A well-mannered person makes the atmosphere around him sunny and pleasant. Everybody enjoys his company. He charms others with his pleasant and polite behavior. Good manners can be shown by using words like ‘Sir’, Mam’, ‘Thank you’, ‘Sorry’, ‘Dear’ etc. Good manners can be seen in the actions also. Offering a seat to an elderly man or woman is also sign of good manners. Such small acts go to long way in winning over others hearts. </p>
 <p>Good manners develop good habits in the person. They reflect his personality and create confidence in him. Good manners beget good manners. They are infectious. One good turns deserves another good turn. Good manners help us to make friends and carve a place for ourselves in the society. </p>

   <span style="Color: Yellow">A Hot Day In summer</span>
   <article>
 <p>Summer is very hot in India. June is hottest month of the year. The heat of the sun becomes unbearable. People perspire from head to foot. Cold drinks are in demand. Baths give little relief. Not only men even birds feel restless in the intense heat of the sun. </p>
 <p>It was the day of 20th June. The sun was extremely hot. I was wet to the bone with sweat. A hot wind was blowing outside. Not a leaf was stirring. The birds were sitting quietly. They were feeling thirsty. Their beaks were wide. Dogs were sitting in drains of dirty water. They were lolling their tongues. The roads looked deserted. </p>
 <p>The afternoon was the hottest part of the day. Nobody likes to go out in the sun. The shop keepers had pulled down their shutters. They were taking rest under fans. The rickshaw pullers were pulling perspiring while plying rickshaws. Parents were waiting for their children from schools. The laborers had left their work. They were sitting in a shady corner.</p>
 <p>The people prayed god for rain. God answered their prayers. Meanwhile clouds gathered in the sky. A cool wind began to blow. Soon it began to rain. There was water everywhere. People came out of their houses. Children began playing in rain water. The birds started chirping. The weather became pleasant. People heaved a sigh of relief. There was a mood of fun and gaiety. </p>

 <article>
 
 <p>Hostel life has a charm of its own. It teaches students a number of lessons which they can`t learn otherwise. It makes them self dependent and active. They learn how to act and live within a framework of certain rules and regulations. They develop a spirit of co-operation and fellow-feelings. They acquire those qualities which go a long way in making their future regular and successful. </p>
 <p>In a hostel there are various types of students. Some are very hard-working and keep themselves busy in their studies. They make the best use of their time. There are others who are non-serious. They are always upto some mischief. They do not take interest in studies and simply waste the hard earnt money of their parents. Hostel-life is like family-life. All take food from the same mess which is run on co-operative basics. </p>
 <p>In a hostel, most of the students are fond of talking. They talk for hours together about their classmates, films and politics. Sometimes they miss classes and go to see movies. They know that there is no one to check them. In a hostel, all live together. They learn how to help one another in the hour of need. They make life-long friends and develop independent thinking. But there are certain carefree young boys who destroy their career by indulging bad habits. </p>
 <p>Hostel-life gives a golden opportunity to students to develop their personality. They face the life of their own. It creates confidence in them and makes their personality richer. They come to develop self discipline. They become responsible and responsive in their life. In this way the foundation of their future career is laid on firm grounds </p>

 <span style="Color: Yellow">Honesty</span>
 <article>
 
 <p>Honesty is very rare quality. Therefore it is greatly valued. It teaches us to be fair and square in our dealings. An honest person is not only expected but trusted in society. He makes big gains and carves a place in the hearts of people around him. Man may become richly overnight by dishonest means but that richness does not last too long.
 <p>Honesty makes a man self-Confident and bold. He does not feel afraid of any body. He moves about his head held high in the air. Honesty is long-termed investment. On other dishonesty is a vice. It breeds corruption. It causes a moral feel on people. The fruit of dishonesty is bitter. Dishonest persons suffer mentally.
 <p>Outwardly they may look happy but inwardly they are not at peace with themselves. They are not connected with what they have. Their sins haunt him. No doubt the number of dishonest persons is far greater than those of honest persons, honesty still remains the best policy.

 <p>Happiness is something which we can’t describe in words it can only be felt from someone’s expression of a smile. Likewise, happiness is a signal or identification of good and prosperous life. Happiness is very simple to feel and difficult to describe. Moreover, happiness comes from within and no one can steal your happiness.</p>
 <p>As we know that money can`t buy happiness and there is no shortcut to happiness. It is something that you feel from within.</p>

 <span style="Color: Yellow">Hardwork</span>
 <article>
 <p>Work is essential for man. It makes the world move. Life is not possible without work. Work is another form of worship. God himself remains busy in work. He creates creatures and looks after all them. He has no rest for a moment. Man has to work to keep himself alive. Human civilization is the result of man`s hardwork of centuries. </p>
 <p>There are people who don`t work hard. They look upon work as something dull and tiring. They think that it is injurious to health. But they sadly mistaken. They don`t know that work give us health and happiness. Hardwork keeps us fit and fine. Without it man becomes lazy. Different organs of their body lose their strength. Those who spend their time in cushioned beds fall ill. Life becomes a burden for them.</p> 
 <p>Hardwork is an activity not only of the body but also of the mind. One is called physical work and other mental work. It a man does not do physical work, his body becomes weak. Similarly mental work is essential for mental alertness. Laborers and menial workers earn their living by doing physical work. Scholars and researchers make use of their mental faculty. They give beautiful ideas and visions. </p>
 <p>Hardwork determines man`s place in society. An ideal person commands no respect in the society. Nobody likes his company. Everybody keeps him at an arm`s length. He is looked upon as a liability. On other hand, a hardworking person is admired and rewarded everywhere. It is only through hardwork that he makes his life joyful and peaceful. A man who is busy in work never develops and bad habit. He makes the best use of his time. If we want to make this world beautiful we should keep ourselves busy in work</p>

 <p>If I win a lottery, I would buy a beautiful bungalow in a nice colony and lead a peaceful life. Buying a lottery ticket at least keeps our hopes alive of becoming rich overnight. Even if I don’t win anything, there is no harm in living in the dream world for some days. The world around us is full of haste and confusion. We spend the whole day working hard and what is the reward? We hear of so many fairies helping the human beings in their lives and making them millionaires overnight.</p>
 <p>If I win a lottery, first of all I would thank God. I would donate some part of my money to the temple. I would make a comfortable house for my family. It would be a small and simple house. House is one of basics needs of man. I would give some money to my elder brother. I would buy a dog. </p>
 <p>I would spend a part of this money on public welfare. I would start a free dispensary for poor people. I would give some money to an orphanage. The orphans should be given free education. They should become good citizens. Person who are blind and disabled also deserve help. I would donate some money to a local institution to spend it on such persons.</p>
 <p>Last of all, I would deposit major part of the money to the bank. I would get monthly interest on it. It would add to my income. I would spend this money to fulfill my personal needs. I would buy new clothes after two or three months. I would buy some new books which would make me better person. I would not make any show of my wealth. I would not let it turn my head.</p>

 <article>
 <p>The world of realities is dull and boring. It gets on our nerves. We can find escape from it through imagination only. It is an imagination that makes life tolerable. It transports us to the world of beauty and romance. What we can`t get or become in reality. We can achieve that with the help of imagination. Sometimes, I wish to become a bird. </p>
 <p>If I was a bird, I would live among green trees. I would not have to face housing problems. I would be free to gather my food from any place. I would not be subject to human law. </p>
 <p>If I were a bird, I would not have to study. The fear of examination would not haunt me. I would not have to get up early and go to school with a bag full of books. Money-matter would not worry me. The question of employment, earning, spending and saving would not arise in my life. I would be happy to live in the company of nature. </p>
 <p>If I were a bird, I would live in an ideal world. My world would be free from evils of human society. It would be a world where corruption and dishonesty would be out of place. There would be no pollution of any kind. I would breathe fresh air and sing glories of god. I would fly high in the sky. I would see how clouds burst and cause rain. While flying in the sky, I would look downwards and enjoy the sights of tall mountains, green forests and deep seas. But it is sad that imagination can`t keep us away from the world of realities forever. </p>

 <article>
 <p>Everybody has their future plans. He wants to become great and do something memorable. I see how standards of education are falling last. Students have lost interest in studies in studies. Indiscipline is growing day by day. Teachers do not take their job seriously. Teaching is no longer a mission for them. If I were the principal of my school, I would try to set matters right. </p>
 <p>First of all, I would check indiscipline among students. Irregular or unpunctual students would be made regular and punctual. For this matter, I would not use force of any kind. Love and persaution alone can bring about change in them. I would keep contacts with their parents. The co-operation of parents can go a long way in improving bad students. </p>
 <p>I know the most of the evils are due to absence of religious education. I would begin the school with a prayer to God, meditation for keeping the students calm and morning assembly exercises for keeping students healthy and fresh-minded. For keeping the students physically and mentally fit, I would set PT period everyday for all the classes 4-12th. I would create regard for human values. I would lay stress on character-building. Honest, regular and obedient students would be awarded every year. </p>
 <p>I would encourage students to take part in games. Games help in the balanced growth of young men. I would organize more and more cultural programmes in the school. Students would be made to take active part in these programmes. I would help the poor and needy students by giving them scholarships. I would also see that the teachers did not shrink their duties. Action would be taken against those teachers who are found guilty. In this way, I would try to make my school a model school. </p>

 <span style="Color: Yellow">If I were Invisible</span>
 <article>
 <p>To become invisible is such an amazing fantasy that surely most of the people on the planet would have imagined at some point of time in their life. There are absolutely endless possibilities that one can do if they become invisible even for a day. There would be no worldly rules or boundaries to stop anybody from anything. That is why, in this time and age, people fear people more than the real monsters</p>
 <p>An invisible person would feel like a genie as he would be able to fulfill all his wishes. An invisible person would not be stopped or checked by anybody. He could travel wherever he wishes to, he can tease anybody and peep anywhere. Undoubtedly, anybody who becomes invisible would think according to his caliber, his mental ability and for his materialist or fantasized needs. Some would acquire position, some power, others, the riches of the world. But sadly, nobody would bother to look at the bigger picture of resolving the bitter problems of the society. There are so many things that one can do that would prove beneficial to mankind. One can feed the poor, or unmask the terrorist or acquire knowledge of the unknown mysteries of the world.</p>
 <p>One day, if I become invisible, firstly, I will thank God for choosing me and giving me the opportunity to put things right. I will use my power in the most fruitful manner proving a blessing to the humanity. My ambition would neither be the richest nor the power. I would just simply help people in need like the superheroes in the movies. For that I don’t even wish anything in return, not even fame. I would be contended seeing the people happy.</p>
 <p>However, invisibility can prove a little boring when nobody would be able to see or hear the invisible person. It would be like nullifying one’s own identity. It is juxtaposed to the goal of every man. Every man or woman wish to make a place for themselves in the society. Infact, inspite of doing good deeds, the invisible person can unintentionally prove immoral to some. Also ‘great power comes with great responsibility’; with such a power at hand any strictly moral person can think malicious. So, the power would have to be handled with care.</p>

The only thing that is he should be eligible to occupy these offices. To become the Prime minister of India may be like day-dreaming for me. But if ever I become the Prime minister of the country, I would like to do a number of things. </p>
 <p>First of all, I would try to remove corruption. Corruption has become the order of the day. Right from the peon to a high officer all are corrupt. You can`t get a work done in an office without giving bribery. I shall make strict laws to deal with corrupt officials. Those who are found guilty would be straightway sent to jail. Their properties would be seized. The honest and dutiful official persons would be rewarded.</p> 
 <p>I would try to control rising prices. The unchecked rise in prices has broken the back of common people. For the poor people, it has become very difficult to make both ends meet. In order to keep the prices under control, I would see that the production is increased. I would open fair-price shops. Hoarders, black-marketers and smugglers would be severely dealt with. </p>
 <p>I would try to remove unemployment. I would create more and more jobs opportunities. I would set up new industries. I would strengthen the defense of our country. I would make education free and job-oriented. I would try to give orders of planting trees and plants in many places.  I would improve relation with neighboring countries.

India has 8 union territories. As regards population it is second in the world. Since it is a heavily populated country, the people are very poor. The bruisers ruled over it for two hindered years. Thoroughly exploited it to their advantage. The national leaders of India drove the bruisers out and it became free in 1947.</p>
 <p>Now is a democratic country. The country framed its own constitution which came into force in 1951. Elections are held after regular intervals. After 1947 India had made rapid progress in every field. It has made a number of five – year plans. It has achieved self – sufficiency in food. It has set up big industries. The country has made a remarkable progress in science and technology. It has conducted a number of nuclear explosions. India has made a name of itself in the field of information and technology. </p>
 <p>India's progress is an eyesore to its neighboring countries. China and Pakistan in particular are jealous of India`s progress. China attacked India in 1962 and Pakistan in 1965 and in 1971. India has strengthened its forces by making latest war weapons. Now these countries will not dare to attack it. A day will come when hopes to become a super power in the world. </p>
 <p>India is a country where there is a unity in diversity. It is a land of different religions. People are free to any religion. They speak different languages. They wear different dress. They have different food habits. Despite these differences, they are one. They are Indians first and Indians are last. I am proud of my country. </p>

 <span style="Color: Yellow">Kindness to animals</span>
 <article>
 
 <p>Like human beings animals are also the creatures of God. Animals are equal sharers of natural gifts with men. But it is a pity that human beings treat animals cruelly. They kill animals to eat their meat. They kill certain animals to conduct medical experiments. They use animals like donkeys, horses and oxen as beast of burden. They put some animals and birds in a cage for fun`s sake. These animals and birds are doomed to lead a solitary life. </p>
 <p>People should know that animals are also living beings. They feel like human beings. The same life runs through them all. Life is as dear to them as to human beings. They also love to move and live freely. They react as human beings do when tortured. They too have physical that they have to satisfy. Men should be thankful to them for what they do for them. </p>
 <p>People should show kindness to animals just as they do to their pets. They take a lot of care of their dogs, cows and cats. They give them bath and feed them at regular intervals. They clean their place of living. They try to give them comfort. Whenever the pets fall ill, they take them to veterinary hospital. People should give the same kind of treatment to other animals also. They should stop eating meat. They should hunt them for fun and enjoyment. </p>
 <p>Some people express the view that if animals are not killed, they will attack human beings. But such people are not right in holding this view. All animals are not dangerous. Nor do all animals kill human beings. Life will come impossible without animals. They must be protected at all costs. Special forests should be made to protect animals. Birds should be kept in sanctuaries for security and safety. Hunting and killing of animals should be prohibited.</p>

 <span style="Color: Yellow">Life in a big city</span>
 <article>
 <p>God made a country, man made the town. Cities symbolize man’s greed for material progress. It is natural then that life in cities is artificial. It is nothing more than earning and spending. Life in a big city is marked by hurry and worry. There is a mad rush everywhere. People are busy from morning till evening. The horns of cars and buses deafen the passers-by. There are traffic jams. </p>
 <p>Life in a big city is full of discomforts. All the big cities are thickly populated. The pressure of population is felt in every field. People especially the poor have to live in misery. They suffer from all kinds of shortages. There are repeated power failures. Water-supply is irregular. Hospitals, schools and colleges are over-crowded. Money plays an important role. The atmosphere is stuffy and dirty. There is no proper sanitation. Heaps of rubbish are seen everywhere. </p>
 <p>Life in a big city has its own charm. There are beautiful buildings with flowery lawns. There are schools, colleges, cinemas and clubs. The means of transport are many and cheap. There are hospitals with latest techniques and medical facilities. There are beautiful gardens. In cities one comes across educated persons. Newspapers bring latest news. Knowledge about things is refreshed and updated. </p>
 <p>Life in a big city is a mixture of opposite elements. On one hand there are palatial buildings. On the other there are slums. Wealth and poverty exist side by side. The people die of hunger and of over-eating. Rich people have fat purses but beggars have empty bellies. People suffer from every type of pollution. In this way life in a big city is one of both joys and sorrows. </p>

 <span style="Color: Yellow">Morning Walk</span>
 <article>
 <p>Morning walk is one of the best exercises. It keeps us physically fit. It refreshes our mind and prepares us for day s work. The atmosphere is very clean. There are no dust particles. We breathe fresh air which purifies our lungs. The cheerful notes of birds delight our ears. We see how flowers open their petals to the morning coolness. The buds wave their head in the cool breeze.</p>
 <p>Nature is at its best in the morning. Field all around look green with smiling crops. The gentle sound on tube well water sends a wave of joy in the body. The darkness of night draws to a close. The landscape is bathed in the light of early morning. The stars begin to lose shine with the rising of the Sun. The birds chirp in their nests. They fly about in groups to gather straws.</p>
 <p>On the way, the farmers are seen going to their fields. The milkmen are going on their bicycles with cans of milk. The groups of old persons are taking brisk walk. Some of them are holding sticks in their hands. Stray dogs bark at them. While going along they discuss family matters. Some people carry towels with them. They take bath in a canal before returning home.</p>
 <p>Morning walk is an exercise which does not cost anything. To walk barefooted on the dewy grass is good for our eyes. Our body and mind feel fresh. Morning walk makes us active and smart. It develops in us the habit of early-rising. It breaks the dullness and laziness of our body. It makes us calm and quite. It is considered to be a secret of long life. Therefore I enjoy morning.</p>

 <span style="Color: Yellow">My ambititon in life</span>
 <article>
 <p>Aim gives purpose and direction to life. Without aim life is like a boat with no oar. Nothing good and great can be achieved without aim. A man without aim becomes a creature of circumstances. He goes astray in life. His life ends in a fiasco. Therefore a man must have some definite goal in life. </p>
 <p>If it is essential to have an aim in life, it is equally essential that the aim should be right one. A wrong aim ruins a man. All his efforts go waste. His time and energy prove fruitless. A man must set an aim before him right in his early life. The choice of an aim depends on the taste and inclination of a person. However one can seek the advice of wise persons in this matter. </p>
 <p>Different people have different aims. Some want to become teacher. Some want to become doctors. Some people think by becoming a doctors or an engineer, they can win name and fame in the society. Still others aspire to become I.A.S or P.C.S. officers. They want to enjoy the power and authority. But I don`t want to become any of them. </p>
 <p>I want to become a company owner of my own. A company leader is a man who makes things for his nation. His job is very good and profitful. I shall pray god to help to me achieve my goal. </p>

 <article>
 <p>Childhood is the golden period of life. During this period, a child is looked with utmost love and care. He is very close to God. He is innocent and pure. He is free from the worries of future life. All these desires are fulfilled without delay. He is ignorant of the evils of life. He has no ill-will against anybody. He enjoys all types of freedom. He is a centre of attraction for the members of his family. </p>
 <p>My childhood is really unforgettable. I love to recall my good old days. In my childhood, I was greatly loved. I was free to make any mischief. No one took me to task. My parents did not leave me anywhere. A strict watch was kept on my activities. My mother used to use to tell me fairy tales at night. </p>
 <p>In my childhood, my demands were immediately supplied. My father would bring new toys for me. My mother would see that I am finely dressed. She would buy me new clothes after two or three months. My elder brother attended most of the time on me. He would bring sweets for me from the market. My birthday was an occasion for fun and joy for them. </p>
 <p>I was little naughty in my childhood. Sometimes quarrel with the children of our neighbors. I would not let them touch my toys. My brother is busy in studies, I would enter their room and hide and when he winds up I seek him and scare him. But he never gets angry on me. He played with me wherever he go he took me along with him. I still remember how I damaged our television. </p>
 <p>Alas! my childhood is gone now. Only memories of those days are left. They give me pleasure and pain whenever I recall them. </p>

Home is not just a building made of brick and mortar. A house becomes a home if the people living in it have love and understanding with each other. Not only human being, but birds and animals also love to make a home. </p>
 <p>My home is built in a posh locality of the town. It is neither too big nor small. It is big enough for our small family. My father, my mother, my brother and I live in it. The outer design of my house is attractive. </p>
 <p>Inside it there is one bed with attached bathrooms. There is one lobby, one kitchen, two store rooms and one drawing/Living room. All the rooms are specious and airy. There are two lawns. There is one study room for me and my brother. The kitchen is in the front. The outside view is visible from kitchen.</p>
 <p>The bed rooms are well-made and well-equipped. The floor is made of black marble. There is a TV set for our bed room. One store is upstairs and the second store is downstairs. Above all, the members of our family have love and regard for each other. All live for one, one live for all. And it is this practice which has made a sweet home. </p>

 <p>Hobby is something which is followed in free time. It gives a person education and entertainment. It enables him to use free time in a purposeful manner. It breaks the dullness of his routine life. Hobby keeps his mind occupied. Otherwise an empty brain becomes a devil`s workshop. </p>
 <p>There is a wide range of hobbies. Stamp-collecting, photography, painting, gardening and coin-collecting are some well-hobbies. Photography keeps meeting new people and visiting new places. But it is a costly hobby. Painting sharpens our imagination. It is no less costly. Gardening brings us close to nature. In order to pursue it one needs a piece of land. After much and careful thought, I have chosen stamp-collecting as my hobby. </p>
 <p>I have large collection of stamps. They belong to different countries and different periods. I get these stamps from my friends and live aboard. Sometimes, I buy them from the market also. I have several stamps which are costly and rare too. I have pasted my stamps in an album. </p>
 <p>I spend my free time in studying them. They give me a lot of information about the ages when they were issued. Some of the stamps have photographs of great men like Nehru, Gandhi and Bose. Some carry the photographs of the important events. I have found that the stamps of England do not bear the name of the country. I have taken part in several stamp collecting competitions. I have won a number of prizes also. </p>
 <p>In this way my hobby is quite absorbing. It keeps me busy in free time. It has cultivated in me some good habits like seeking and finding.    </p>

 <span style="Color: Yellow">National Integration</span>
 <article>
 <p>India is a big country. People of different religions live here. They speak different languages and wear different clothes. They also quarrel in the name of language, regions and states. The result is communal riots. There is incalculable loss of life and property. The problem is to bring national annuity in them. </p>
 <p>The picture that presents seems to be gloomy. Divisive forces are very active. Punjab has witnessed a lot of bloodshed in the past years. Kashmir is burning. Assam is in a grip of violence. Anti-national forces are taking full advantage of the disturbed conditions. If India is to remain annuity, emotional integration is every essential. People should to accept each other. One should live for all and all should live for one. </p>
 <p>Spread of education can help in bringing about national integration. It is uneducated people who easily get misted. Economic upliftment of poor is equally essential. A hungry is an angry-man. He can do anything for the sake of empty stomach. He can join hands with the anti-national forces. Inter-caste marriages can also help to achieve national integration. The government should encourage such marriages. </p>
 <p>The mass-media can prove very useful in this matter. In newspapers write-ups should be published to promote unity and understanding among various sections of the society. More and more plays should be telecast on the subject of national unity. In order to develop understanding and love, festival of one community should be celebrated by one and all. We should remember that united we stand and divided we fall. </p>

 <article>
 <p>Picnics and tours are essential to break the dullness of routine life. They refresh man s mind and provide him much needed relief. It was the month of October. It neither so harm nor so cold. One day me and my friends decided to go to park named Picnic Park. The park is not in our city it was out of the city. We had our own cycles. We took eatable things, drinks and other things. We reached the picnic spot at 08:00 AM.</p>
 <p>We selected a shady corner and spread carpet. There we changed our clothes and sat down to rest and gossip for some time. All were in happy and gay mood. After about half an hour, we took bath. After, bath we have our breakfast. Then, we played football. One of us distributed snacks. Instead of cold drinks, we took orange juice.</p>
 <p>After breakfast we sat down to play cards. We had carried our music phones with us. We played music of our choice. Mean-while it was lunch time. All of us ate the food to our heart. We rested for some time. Therefore, we took nap for two hours. When we woke up, we felt need to take juice. I prepared juice for all of us. We all enjoyed it amidst jokes and tit-bites</p>
 <p>Meanwhile clouds gathered in the sky. It was getting dark. We feared than if it began to rain, we would be held up there. Therefore we wanted to reach home before it started raining. We collected all our things and packed them in our bags. We started back well in time. Hardly we reached our homes when a strong wing started to blow. After some time there was a heavy rainfall. We thanked God for showing a favor to us. Thus we had a very enjoyable picnic. The memories of that day are still fresh in my mind. </p>

 <p>A true patriot is a person with broad vision. He is international in his outlook and sympathy. He loves his country but does not hate other countries. For him his country is as big as this universe. He looks upon mankind as his family. If he works for the progress of his country, he does obstruct the progress of other nations. </p>
 <p>A true patriot is not narrow in outlook. Narrow-nationalism is dangerous for world peace. It spreads hatred among nations and promotes mutual destruct. There are leaders whose patriotism is false. They play with the sediments of his countrymen. They exploit this sediment for the promotion of their personal ends. We should avoid pseudo-patriot. </p>

 <span style="Color: Yellow">A Rainy Day in Summer</span>
 <article>
 <p>Of all the seasons, summer is most torturing. The heat of the sun is unbearable. When the light goes out, the life becomes hell. All the ponds become dry. Not only men but also birds feel thirsty. When such is the atmosphere, rain is a blessing. It brings relief and comfort for one and all. It sends a wave of joy in every heart.</p> 
 <p>It was 15th of June. The day was very hot. There was not a whiff of air. The trees were still. Birds were not chirping. Dogs were looking for water here and there. People were sweating from head to foot. There was no light. Fans had stopped moving. Everybody was feeling restless. No relief seemed in sight. </p>
 <p>Suddenly dark clouds started gathering in the sky. Soon the sky was overcast with clouds. Darkness spread everywhere. A cool wind started blowing. In a short time big drops of rain began to fall. The clouds were thundering. The flashes of lighting were coming and going. The gentle showers were soon followed by heavy downpour. The weather became cool and pleasant. Everybody heaved a sigh of relief. Children came out to float paper-boats. They began to play in the rain water.</p>
 <p>After sometime the rain stopped. Everybody looked cheerful. Greenery could be seen all around. The streets were full of water. It was difficult to pass them. The rickshaw-pullers had a field day. They charged the fare to their will. Towards the evening a rainbow appeared in the sky. The scene looked beautiful. Although the water in the streets started subsiding, the streets became slippery. Despite all this, the atmosphere turned cool and pleasant.</p>

 <span style="Color: Yellow">Qualities of a Good teacher</span>
 <article>
 <p>Education is the most important part in one’s life. Teachers come in all types and sizes. For example, based on my own experience during schooling days, some teachers are very good, whereas some teachers are not that good. Teachers may possess many qualities that are closely related to the teaching values, which encompass the individual, social and professional characteristics and qualities of teachers. Teachers who possess these teaching values will be able to excel and teach efficiently as competent educators. </p>
 <p>A competent teacher should possess individual qualities such as being kind-hearted, humorous, patient, responsible, having confidence and leadership. In my opinion, among all these qualities, patience is the most important quality that a good teacher should possess. A teacher with patience is a teacher who can control emotions appropriately. Such teacher has emotional intelligence, whereby anger will explode in any stressed situation that the teacher encounters. Teacher is always willing to keep explaining when there are students who would just not be “getting” a particular concept in a lesson. Teacher will just stuck with the concept and explain the concept repeatedly to the student until the student copes up with the concept.</p>
 <p>Next, I would confidently say that the attitude of being responsible also plays a major part among those individual roles. A responsible teacher will always attach importance on his/her duties. Such teacher will always strive to work with full dedication to ensure their task is perfectly complete. Teachers with this attitude also have a true compassion for their students. They always care about their students as individuals and wanted to help them when the students</p>
 <p>Face problems either in studies or in life. These teachers are also dedicated towards the excellence of their students. They will do their level best to raise the bar of their students. Even, they always expect the best from their students in order to give the students a sense of confidence in their studies.</p>
 <p>As a conclusion, teachers play a crucial and vital role in the molding of students, who constitute a nation’s future human resource. Every teacher should embed the qualities stated above into their selves, in order to become a competent educator. Through this, the teachers can guide students to attain the knowledge and skills they need to succeed in the world. This is because the nations are the way they are and will be in part because of their teachers.</p>

 <span style="Color: Yellow">Popular Superstitions</span>
 <article>
 <p>Superstitions are unreasonable beliefs. They are born out of ignorance. Although, science has greatly advanced, it has not succeeded in dislodging people faith in superstitions. They still believe in spirit, magic and astrology. Indians are most superstitious people. They believe that diseases are the punishment to man for his misdeeds. Certain days are considered bad for taking journey. Marriages are not held during certain months. </p>
 <p>There are omens-good and bad. When person is ready to set out for a journey, the sneeze by another is considered as a bad omen. The sight of empty vessel is equally ominous. But a bucket full of water is a sign of good luck. The howling of dogs presages someone`s death. The sight of a sweeper is looked upon as a favorable sign. </p>
 <p>If man`s right hand pitches, it means he/she will get unexpected money. The cawing of the crow on the roof in the morning means the arrival the guest. A student tastes curd before going to his examinations. It is believed that it success certain. If a house is empty from years there is a ghost living. Some consider figure 13 to be unlucky. </p>
 <p>Superstitions cause a lot of harm. They weaken man`s self confidence. They bring misery in man`s life. He lives under constant fear of loss and pain. Superstitions check his mental growth. They disturb his peace. We must put an end to superstitions. For that matter we need we need rational outlook. We should let things happen in a natural course. </p>

 <span style="Color: Yellow">Prohibition</span>
 <article>
 <p>Prohibition is the legal check on the evil of drinking. Drinking is one of the destructive vices of the society. It breaks up family life. It disturbs the harmony of the social relations. It weakens human faculties and causes damage to health. That is why it is when wine is in, wit is out. Drinking also results in causes of accidents, quarrels and crimes. Hence the need of Prohibition is must. </p>
 <p>There are people who oppose Prohibition. They say that drinking is the zest of the life. It makes people forget anxieties of daily life. Another argument against Prohibition is that it causes big loss in government revenue. It also gives rise to a number of evils. Since confirmed drunkards can`t abstain from drinking, they stealthily import liquor. The breaking of the law becomes a habit. The secret supply of liquor and illicit distillation become an order of the day. </p>
 <p>The actual working of Prohibition has proved to be a failure. The folly of Prohibition was seen when it was introduced in states like Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra. As a result, corruption increased in the Prohibition enforcement staff. There were angry protests from different quarters. So Prohibition was either scrapped or delayed in many states. </p>
 <p>It is better to discourage people from drinking. It should be done through education and persuasion. It is not right to go the extreme and prohibit drinking. Prohibition may be a good political shunt but it is a bad biological principle. We can`t change a drinker into teetotaler overnight by introducing Prohibition. It is admitted that a small dose of alcohol is an effective tonic. Therefore the use of alcohol will last so long as man lasts on the earth. </p>

 <span style="Color: Yellow">Sportsmanship</span>
 <article>
 <p>Sportsmanship means to play a game according to the prescribed rules. A true sportsman observes these rules in real life also. Sportsmanship implies fair play. One should not cheat others and indulgent in foul play. A sportsman never takes undue advantage of the weakness of his rival. He does not hit below the belt. Respect for discipline is an essential part of sportsmanship. </p> 
 <p>Team spirit is an important element of sportsmanship. Without co-operation success is impossible. Sportsmanship consists in working in full harmony with others. The spirit of sportsmanship demands cheerfulness even in face of defeat. When two players play, the loser does not nurse ill-will against the winner. In life too, we must learn to put up a good face even in defeat. </p>
 <p>Sportsmanship is worthy of admiration. It is conducive to human happiness and welfare. Life in the society can be attractive if all possess the spirit of sportsmanship. All disputes will be settled amicably. Forgive and forget will be the guiding principle of one and all. Mutual understanding will prevail. Persuasion and friendship will replace force and strength. Peace and prosperity will be shared by all. One will live for all and all will live for one. </p>
 <p>It is indeed matter of pity that most people do not understand the meaning of sportsmanship. Our political leaders woefully lack this spirit. They adopt unfair methods to harm their opponents. They lack the spirit of co-operation and fair dealings. The result that is our social set-up is in ruins. There is no regard of rules and regulations. Might has taken the place of night. In order to remove these evils, it is essential to develop and promote the spirit of sportsmanship. </p>

 <span style="Color: Yellow">Social Media</span>
 <article>
 <p>Social Media is a tool that is becoming quite popular these days because of its user-friendly features. Social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and more are giving people a chance to connect with each other across distances. In other words, the whole world is at our fingertips all thanks to social media. The youth is especially one of the most dominant users of social media. All this makes you wonder that something so powerful and with such a massive reach cannot be all good. Like how there are always two sides to a coin, the same goes for social media. Subsequently, different people have different opinions on this debatable topic. So, in this essay on Social Media, we will see the advantages and disadvantages of social media.</p>
 <p>When we look at the positive aspect of social media, we find numerous advantages. All the information one requires is just a click away. Social-Media consists of various things such as Knowledge, Education, Online meetings etc. One of the best features of Social media is that if a student is absent on a day, he could just message his friend to get the work. One can get live lectures in sitting in India from America. Another advantage definitely benefits companies who wish to promote their brands. Social media has become a hub for advertising and offers you great opportunities for connecting with the customer.</p>
 <p>Despite having such unique advantages, social media is considered to be one of the most harmful elements of society. If the use of social media is not monitored, it can lead to grave consequences.</p>
 <p>It is harmful because it invades your privacy like never before. The oversharing happening on social media makes children a target for predators and hackers. It also leads to cyberbullying which affects any person significantly. Social-Media can significantly affect your privacy as Hackers usually send message as a Virus to your device. </p>
 <p>In short, surely social media has both advantages and disadvantages. But, it all depends on the user at the end. The youth must particularly create a balance between their academic performances, physical activities, and social media. Excess use of anything is harmful and the same thing applies to social media. Therefore, we must strive to live a satisfying life with the right balance.</p>

 <span style="Color: Yellow">Summer Vacation</span>
 <article>
 <p>A student works throughout the year. When he gets bored, he longs for holidays. He wants fun and gaiety. Summer vacation gives him needed relief. Some students go to visit their relatives during summer. Others organize trips to hill-stations. Still others like to undertake long tours. During last summer I visited a number of places.</p>
 <p>My uncle lives in Haryana. I decided to spend some holidays with them. My cousins were too free. I went to Haryana by a train. My cousins had come to the station to receive. They took me their home by their car. My uncle and aunty were very happy to see me. My stay with them was indeed and enjoyable. I played with cousins a lot. I made some new friends there. Then one day we decided we go to Agra.</p>
 <p>We went to Agra by train. The journey was too pleasant. We reached Agra at about 11; 00 AM. Agra is a historical place. It is famous for The Taj Mahal. The Taj Mahal is also known as The Taj. We went straight to the spot. The Taj is made of white marble. It was built by Shah Jahan on the bank of river Jamuna. It is a symbol of true love. Many foreigners had come to see it. After seeing the Taj we paid a visit to Fatehpur Sikri. We returned to Haryana after a couple of days.</p>
 <p>I stayed in Haryana for a week more. During these days we saw several movies. One day we went to see an old friend of mine. He received us with open arms. We refreshed our old memories. We took our dinner with him. We returned home quite late home. After having good time, I caught the train and reached home safe and sound. In this way, I spent my summer vacation joyfully.</p>

 <span style="Color: Yellow">Science and Human Happiness</span>
 <article>
 <p>Science has revolutionized the human life. No sphere of human activity has remained untouched by it. Dreams of yesterday have become realities of today. Our ancestors were to revisit this world; they would not believe the progress made by it.</p>
 <p>Science has reduced distances. The world has become small. We can travel round the world in an airplane within 24 hours. Messages to one place to another place can be in no time. Pagers and fax are doing a wonderful job. Science has made a valuable contribution in the field of medicine. It has given ears to the blind, ears to the deaf and legs to the lame. Science has given us means of comfort. Things like heaters and coolers have made life worth living. </p>
 <p>Science has improved agriculture methods. Today farmers have better crops. He can make use of better quality seeds. Agriculture has become mechanized. In the place of ploughs, he can use tractor. He can take advantage of tube wells. Science has made impressive work in the field of industry. The work which done by human hands is now done by machines. Machines dress us and cook our food. They have given us entertainment. Radio, television and cinema fill up are free time. Now the introduction of computers has changed the entire complexion of man's life. </p>
 <p>No doubt science man's life comfortable. But it has taken away his peace of mind. Urbanization has polluted the whole atmosphere of the earth. The world lives under a permanent threat of nuclear war. If the third world war broke out, the entire mankind will be destroyed. Therefore man should learn to use science for constructive work only. </p>

 <span style="Color: Yellow">Socialism</span>
 <article>
 <p>Socialism is a kind of government. It advocates the maximum governmental control over means of production. The essential idea of socialism is the substitution of state-ownership for private-ownership. According to the theory, private-ownership led to economic injustice. Socialism aims primarily at increasing the happiness of all except those who are rolling in riches. </p>
 <p>In a capital system, there are many evils. The competition in industry leads to concentration of money and power. It tends to squeeze out the small man. The result is big economic inequalities. The rich grows richer and poor poorer. There is restless in the society. Socialism appears to provide remedy for these evils. Socialism ensures shorter working house, better working conditions and safeguard against unemployment. </p>
 <p>Everything is not right with socialism. It has a number of defects. There is no such as personal equality in socialism. A system based on the mere principle of equality is not likely to succeed. Next, the abolition of private ownership lessons production. Economic competition is essential to get better results. Socialism has a bad effect upon workers. Since they are sure of employment, they work less than they would do under a private employer. </p>
 <p>Socialism has failed make a dent into capitalism. It has lost its early glamour. The countries which adopted socialism as a form of government have failed to show encouraging results. Socialism is not a magic-wand as it has been made out to be.  It talks of economic growth but it lacks humanism. It feed man`s body but starves human soul. The fall of socialist governments in countries like the U.S.S.R., Poland, Yugoslavia and other have exposed the weakness of socialism. </p>

 <span style="Color: Yellow">Students and Politics</span>
 <article>
 <p>Students are the future of the nation. They have a vital role in shaping its destiny.  It is out of students that the rulers of the nations emerge. Therefore they must be aware of their nation`s problems. They have taken keen interest in the events taking place in the country. </p>
 <p>Now the question is whether or not the student takes part in the politics during their student career. Those who support student`s participation says that it develops their personality. It cultivates in them quality of leadership. They can revive and strengthen human values of life. The old generation has failed to deliver goods. The selfish policies of politicians have brought the country near ruin. Students are a big force. They can certainly change the political spectrum of the country. </p>
 <p>Those who oppose students participants in policies have their own arguments. They say that career is only period when they can gain knowledge. They should waste away their power in useless activities. They should prepare themselves mentally and physically for the struggle of life. Politics is said to be a game of rogues. The students are immature. They become a puppet in the hands of unprincipled politicians. This defeats the purpose of their life. Therefore they shun politics during students’ life. </p>
 <p>Student life is a formative period of life. Students should acquire all those qualities which may help them to be successful in life. An awareness of politics and national issues is not a bad thing. They should not get actively involved in policies. Education and politics are opposed to each other. They students should hold seminars and discussions on issues of national importance they can join politics after their studies are over. </p>

 <span style="Color: Yellow">The dream I saw last night</span>
 <article>
 <p>Dreams, the mysterious and elusive phenomena of the human mind, that often serve as a reflection of our subconscious thoughts, fears and desires. While some dreams can be pleasant and inspiring, others can be terrifying and distressing. </p>
 <p>One night, I found myself trapped in a dystopian world, a horrifying dream that remains etched in my memory. The world was barren and desolate, devoid of life and color. The sky was a perpetual dark grey and the air was thick with an indefinable dread. Buildings crumbled, trees were leafless and silence reigned, echoing the desolation.</p>
 <p>Suddenly, I saw a figure approaching through the desolate landscape. As it neared, I recognized it as an embodiment of my deepest fears and insecurities. It was a grotesque, monstrous entity, a symbol of failure, rejection, and despair. The encounter was terrifying, leaving me paralyzed and helpless.</p>
 <p>Upon waking, I was overwhelmed by a sense of relief, realizing it was only a dream. However, the dream served as a stark reminder of the fears and insecurities that I had been subconsciously suppressing. It forced me to confront these fears, leading to introspection and self-analysis.</p>
 <p>A horrible dream despite its distressing nature, can be a powerful tool for self-realization and growth. It can expose our deepest fears and insecurities, prompting us to address them consciously. While the experience may be unpleasant, the introspection it triggers can lead to personal development and emotional resilience.</p>

 <span style="Color: Yellow">The Best Season of The Year</span>
 <article>
 <p>There are four major seasons of the year. These four seasons are Spring, Winter, Rainy and Summer. Of all these seasons, Spring is considered to be best. It is called the queen of seasons. It is a season of freshness and beauty. Every object is full of life. A comparative study of seasons will mark it out as the best of all seasons. </p>
 <p>Summer season is torturing season. The sun shines brightly. Its scoring heat is unbearable. The earth virtually burns and trees become leafless. Dry and pale leaves lie scattered here and there. Birds leave their nest and take shelter somewhere else. There is no chirping and flapping on the trees. Human beings feel dull and cheerless. They perspire from head to foot. Life without electricity seems hell. Nobody likes to go out in the heat of the sun. some become victims of sun-stroke. </p>
 <p>Like summer season, winter also has its woes. During this season, cold winds blow. There is chill in the atmosphere. One does like to come out of the quilt. In order to get warm, too many woolen clothes have to be put on. A poor man can`t afford such things. Those who are homeless live in the open. They burn fire on a roadside and sit beside it. </p>
 <p>The rainy season is too bad. The weather becomes stuffy after rainfall. The roads and streets are full of water. Sometimes heavy rainfall causes floods. Crops are damaged. Houses also collapse. Insects like mosquitoes become a nuisance. Again the poor people are the worst sufferers. </p>
 <p>Finally we come to the spring season. It is the best season. The weather during this season is very pleasant. Nature is at its best. There is greenery everywhere. Flowers bloom and fruit ripen. Birds chirp and tree-leaves rustle. There is song in every heart. </p>

 <span style="Color: Yellow">The book I liked the most</span>
 <article>
 <p>The book I like most is 'Black-Beauty'. This is a book about a horse named Black Beauty. He was a wise, brave, fine horse. He had a lot of hard experiences. He could understand men's words and feelings. He was sold several times, and had various kinds of masters. Some people treated him very well, others did cruelly. Although he had a hard time because of men' selfishness, he served them very well through his almost all life.</p>
 <p>A black horse was born of the wise, well-treated one. His mother told him the manner to serve men as a good horse. She said to him, "The better you behave, the better you will be treated. Do your best to please your master." As he was trained, he grew handsome. After getting basic skills, he was taken away to Birtwick Park, apart from his mother.</p>
 <p>At Birtwick Park he met a little pony named Merrylegs and tall brown mare with a long handsome neck named Ginger there. They became good friends each other. His master named him Black Beauty. The groom, John trained him very well. Black Beauty performed great exploits. He was very happy. One day, new groom, Joe Green who was a fourteen-year boy, joined there.</p>
 <p>After Black Beauty's great work to save the life of his ill mistress, Joe didn't take proper care of him, so he nearly died. John was very angry, but he knew Joe was not bad. After that, Joe learned many things quickly and became a good groom gradually. </p>
 <p>Three years later, his master had to move to a warm climate for his wife's health. Therefore, Black Beauty and Ginger were sold and they moved to Earl shall Park. They worked as carriage horses. It was very hard, but they bore. Nevertheless, they live happily. One day, the accident happened. Reuben was gentle and clever as a manager of horses, and as a driver. He had, however, one fault that he sometimes drank too much. He drove Black Beauty unmercifully until he was injured. Black Beauty knew something was wrong, but of course he could not tell Reuben so. Finally, he fell because of his broken hoof and Reuben died.</p>

The morning assembly is held in the assembly hall or in the open. Just as morning shows the day, similarly the morning assembly shows the daily working of the school. </p>
 <p>The school begins with long bell. On hearing the bell students go to their class-rooms. They keep their satchels on their seats. Meanwhile their class-teachers also come to their classes. When the second bell is rung, the students move towards the place of assembly in a line. Their class-teachers are also with them. The students stand class-wise and section-wise in the rows. The school principle and all the teachers are presents in the assembly. </p>
 <p>Their physical education teacher conducts the assembly. The students listen to their instructions. There is silence in the assembly. Three to four students appear on the stage.

 <span style="Color: Yellow">The Evil of Dowry</span>
 <article>
 <p>Dowry is a cash or kind which girl`s parents give to her at the time of her marriage. In old days it was a voluntary act and it was given as a token of affection. But now it has become an essential part of a marriage. The people have grown greedy. Many young girls have lost their lives. </p>
 <p>We are living in age of materialism. Everybody is lost in the rat race for money. Money has become a powerful factor to measure one`s status in the society. Rich people purchase boys for their daughters. For poor people it has become a problem to find a suitable match for their daughters. Dowry system encourages many evils. Several young girls are married to misfit persons for want of dowry. Several others remain unmarried.  </p>
 <p>Dowry system is a bolt on woman kind. Girls are looked upon as economic burden. Parents are happy as a birth of a female child. Many parents do not give them education. They get them married at the earliest possible. The evils of dowry do not end with the marriage of a girl. Girls are forced bring even more dowry after marriage. They are not tortured but also burnt. </p>
 <p>Dowry system must be rooted out. People must be educated about it. Young boys and girl should vow that they should marry without dowry. The mass-media should highlight the dangers of this system. Those who give or take dowry should be boycotted. Social-reformers and film makers can play an important part in this evil. It is not laws but the change of hearts which came help us to put an end to this. </p>

 <p>The postman wears a khaki uniform. He carries the dak in a leather bag. He goes to the office at 9 a.m. to collect the dak of his area. He sorts out the articles of dak and arranges them in order. Then he sets out to deliver them. He goes from street to street and door to door. He has to cover a long distance.

In addition, he has holidays on some festivals also. His income was very small. But now the government is trying to improve his lot. He now gets a better pay scale. He is paid bonus also. </p>
 <p>Some postmen do not perform their duty sincerely. They do not deliver letters properly. They hand over the letters to small children. Instead of putting them in letter boxes, they throw them under doors. Many important letters are lost. They should stop doing so. They should try to be helpful and useful public servants. </p>

 <span style="Color: Yellow">The Recess Period in my School</span>
 <article>
 <p>The recess period in a school is a part of its daily time table. It is a period of rest and relaxation for the students and teachers. It is most interesting period because anybody can do anything. This period comes normally in the middle if time-table. This gives a much needed relief to the students from mental exercise of the previous periods.</p>
 <p>The moment bell goes, the students rush out of their classes. It looks as if they have suddenly set free from imprisonment. They shout with joy. They rush and run in different directions. The teachers go eagerly wait this period. They go to staff-room. They chat and take lunch there. </p>
 <p>The students get busy in their own ways. Some begin to do their home-task. Some begin to do their incomplete work. Some of the students play pen-fight and chat with each other. Those students who serious go to the library to read books, magazines, newspapers etc. Most of the students roam in the entire school. </p>
 <p>During the period there is a heavy rush at the washroom. There is a rush in water-tap also. The students stand in the queen and wait for their turn. Those students who did not bring lunch boxes and who don’t want to eat their lunches they hide their lunch boxes and go out of the class-room and roam in the collider. </p>

 <span style="Color: Yellow">The Rickshaw puller/Life of rickshaw puller</span>
 <article>
 <p>A rickshaw is a cheap means of transport. Rickshaws can be commonly seen in small towns and villages. A rickshaw is source of earning of many people. Some have their own rickshaw and some have it on a daily rent. Some ply it during daytime and some at night. </p>
 <p>Rickshaw pullers are seen at the railway stations, bus-stands, cinema houses and busy centers. A rickshaw puller plies his rickshaw in all sorts of weather. Rain or Shine, winter or summer, he plies his rickshaw without complaining. He knows no rest, no holiday. His earning at the end of the day is very small. It is just enough to keep his body and soul together. </p>
 <p>A rickshaw-puller is illiterate. He is poorly dressed. He looks rough and tough. He does not have refined manners. He uses abusive language. He does not mind quarreling with the passengers. Sometimes he even comes to blow also. But all the rickshaw-pullers are not alike. Some are gentle and soft spoken. They do not bargain too much. They demand genuine fare. One fells giving them more than they ask for. </p>
 <p>The job of a rickshaw-puller is by no means an easy one. It is a hard task. It is greatly tiring. It requires physical strength. Most rickshaw-pullers look sad and miserable. The government should try to improve the lot of a rickshaw-puller. A rickshaw-puller should be careful; about his health. He should not waste money on liquor. </p>

 <span style="Color: Yellow">The Problem Of Rising Prices</span>
 <article>
 <p> Rising prices is one of the major problems of India. It has broken the back of common people. There are protest rallies and angry demonstrations’. The number of people below poverty line is increasing. The distressed people sometimes say that the British rule was better than the present rule. The worst hit in this matter is the salaried class. The people get fixed pay. They have to bear the burden of taxes. They are on the brink of starvation. </p>
 <p> One of the factors for price-rise is the faulty policies of government. The purchasing power of money has come down. There is no check on the government expenditure. Price line is linked with demand and supply principle. Supply can`t keep pace with uncontrolled growth of populations. All efforts to check the growth of population have proved useless. </p>
 <p> Black-money is also responsible for unchecked rise in prices. Black-money has increased rich-poor-gap. There is parallel economy working in the country. As long as black money exists, all talk of controlling price-rise sounds funny. Artificial scarcities also contribute to rice-rise. Black-marketers and hoarders take undue advantage of the situation. They hoard goods and sell them at higher rates. Experience shows that the prices which once shoot up never come down. </p>
 <p> The government should take steps to check price-rise. It should remodel its economic policies. The growth of population should be checked. The generation of black money should be curbed. Fair-price shops should be opened for poor people. Hoarders and black-marketers should be firmly dealt with. </p>

 <span style="Color: Yellow">The Problem of Unemployment</span>
 <article>
 <p> Unemployment is an acute in India. People do not get any job to keep their mind and soul together. In old days, when man lived in the lap of nature, there was no such a problems. Unemployment is a curse of modern civilization. With the invention of new things, the needs of man have also increased. But is a lack of employment opportunities. </p>
 <p> The problem of unemployment is a creation of British. They created this to demoralize the youth of India. But the educated and uneducated are still suffering from the unemployment. The main cause of mass unemployment among the educated people is our defection education system. The education of today is aimless and directionless. It is not vocational. It fails to inculcate the dignity of labor among young men</p>
 <p> Our increasing population has also contributed to the creation of this problem. The population is rising day by day. The government has failed to create equal number of job opportunities. The economy of the country is weak and backward. Unemployment has a number of ugly aspects. An unemployment youth gives up moral standards. He begins to include in anti-social activities. He would rather die than live a life of misery. He does not desist from commuting suicide. </p>
 <p> The government should take immediate to deal with this problem. First of all our education system should be overhauled and made job-oriented. Second, growing population should be checked. The growth of production should keep pace with the growth of population. More and more job opportunities should be created. The economic policies should be remodeled to tone up the economy of the country. </p>

 <span style="Color: Yellow">Value of trees</span>
 <article>
  <p>Since the beginning, trees have furnished us two of life`s essential, food and oxygen. As we evolved, they provided additional necessities such as shelter, medicine and tools. Today, their value continues to increase and more benefits of trees are being discovered as their role expands to satisfy the needs created by our modern lifestyles. </p>
  <p>Trees are an important part of every community. Our streets, parks, playgrounds and backyards are lined with trees that create a peaceful environment. Trees increase our quality of life by bringing natural elements and wildlife habitats into urban settings. We gather under the cool shade they provide during outdoor activities with family and friends. Many neighborhoods are also the home of very old trees that serve as historic landmarks and a great source town pride. </p>
  <p>Trees contribute to their environment by providing oxygen, improving air quality, conserving water, preserving soil, and supporting wildlife. During the process of photosynthesis, trees take in carbon dioxide and produce the oxygen we breathe. We can use trees in cities to deflect the sunlight that reduces the heat island effect caused by pavement and commercial buildings.  </p>
  <p>The conclusion is that we have to understand the importance of trees, without trees there is no life possible as they provide us oxygen. The human society is cutting the trees to construct roads, cutting forests to construct various supermarkets and even they are killing animals to eat them. We should prevent these things and killing of animals should be prohibited. We should try to plant us much trees as much as possible. </p>

 <span style="Color: Yellow">Value of parents</span>
 <article>
  <p>Parents are the most influential people in the life of their children. Parents sacrifice many things in their lives and decrease their cost of living to shape their child’s futures. They also provide help and support to their children in every step of their lives.</p>
  <p>Parents are the first teachers in the life of their children. Our parents play an essential role in our psychological, physical, social, financial and career development. You might know very well that parenting a child is not simple or easy. It isn’t easy to raise a child right from the day he or she is born. We should always respect our parents throughout our lives, regardless of the situation or what they say. Whatever they tell us is always for our good life and our well-being. We should always value their decisions in our life.</p>
  <p>If you face any problems or difficulties in your life, then discuss those with your parents. Always be honest with your parents and tell them about each occurrence of your life. They are your best well-wishers in this world. They always think good for you. They never do ill thinking for you or never wish anything wrong for you. Our parents always pray to God about our well-being, which we never know about. Treat them with good behavior, and always talk with them politely. </p>
  <p>Also, be obedient to your parents at every point of your life. When you discuss your life issues with your parents, they will help you figure out what to do to get out of that situation or, they will find out and suggest ways of how you can stay peacefully and happily, despite problems, if any. Father and Mother of a child are the best solution-providers in this world to their children. They never want that you will stay in trouble. Somehow or the other, they help you to get out of your problems. It is true said that ‘There is no love more significant than a mother’s love and no care greater than a father’s care’. </p>
  <p>The Conclusion is that parents are themselves a solid and ideal role model for their children during their teenage. Whatever they do or how they behave affects their children’s mentality. You can involve your child in discussions within the family and you can encourage them to have a balanced diet and lead a healthy and happy lifestyle. You can be positive in every situation. You can teach them to take responsibility for their actions by, first of all, doing that yourself. Parents instill the importance of family values in their children.</p>

 <span style="Color: Yellow">Value of discipline </span>
 <article>
  <p>Discipline means self-control. It requires a person to observe certain rules of conduct. It is necessary to live a civilized life. Its absence creates disorder. No progress is possible without it. It is very essential in every field of life. There can be no peace and justice without it. Without discipline man is nothing more than an animal. </p>
  <p>Children learn discipline from their parents. Therefore it is necessary that first of all parents should be disciplined. Students learn discipline from their teachers. Only disciplined teachers can teach students to observe discipline. The fall in indiscipline result in the fall of academic standards. We can learn discipline from heavenly bodies. The sun, the moon and the stars move according to the law of nature. </p>
  <p>Discipline is a life-breath of an army. No army can be imagined without discipline. Without discipline an army is nothing but a crowd of people. Discipline is needed in political life also. If political leaders are not disciplined, they can`t deliver the goods. They will ruin the country. Discipline in the playground is no less important. No game is possible if the rules of the games are not observed. </p>
  <p>There are people who don`t like discipline. They say that the discipline check their freedom. But such people are wrong. They should know that the absence of discipline means death and destruction. Discipline should not be imposed without correct behavior. It should come from within. Only this discipline is enduring. Democracy will survive only if people are disciplined. </p>
  <p>Discipline regulates our life. It makes life worth-living. People should realize their responsibilities. They should perform their duties honestly. Discipline alone should govern their daily activities</p>

 <article>
  <p>Television is popularly described as a wonder box. It has brought about a big change in man`s life. Today it has become a necessity for every family. It is an improvement of radio.

  <p>It is generally complained that the students waste much of their valuable time in watching television. They do so at cost of their studies. Television has a bad effect on eye-sight also. Therefore television should be watched only sparingly. </p>

 <span style="Color: Yellow">Value of travelling</span>
 <article>
 <p>Travels and trips hold a great charm. They give us an opportunity to visit new and meet new people. The knowledge that we get from them is first hand and unforgettable. We try to learn detail about them. The experience thus gained is better and richer. Therefore travels should be made a regular part of the educational scheme.</p>
 <p>Travels to new places sharpen our power of observing. When we see new places we try to understand them fully. We form a picture in our minds which may not be forgettable. Our curiosity about unvisited places is aroused. We make a full use of our eyes and mind. As a result we become mentally alert and receptive to expressions. 	</p>
 <p>Travel enables us to meet new places and know their life-style. It is a real delight to meet new people who speak different languages and put on new types of clothes. We get an opportunity to make new friendships. We feel that we are a member of a big family called Mankind. We come to develop sympathy and understanding for each other. </p>
 <p>Travels bring us in close contact with nature. We see nature in all its shape and mood. We see mountains with their towering peaks. Beauty, charm and quietness of nature present a feast for our eyes. For the time being we forget the worries of our daily life. </p>
 <p>Travels bring life and art within our reach and knowledge. Whatever knowledge we have about historical buildings, art and architecture is bookish and imperfect. But travels give us first hand information about them. We come to realize that life is an adventure. The spirit of adventure does not let us rest at home. Whenever we get an opportunity to travel somewhere we should go there. Thus travels are both educative and entertaining.</p>

 <span style="Color: Yellow">Value of books</span>
 <article>
  <p>Books have become very important in modern man's life. They have proved useful in the progress of human civilization. They are man`s long life companion. Books are the store life of the knowledge. They contain the wisdom of ages. They serve as a lighthouse in man`s life. They show him the right path of life. They remove the darkness of ignorance. </p>
  <p>Books are man's never failing friends. Whenever man feels sad, books keep his company. They entertain him with their sweet words. They break the dullness of his daily life. The delight that they give is more lasting. Whenever man falls on evil days, his friends and relatives desert him. Books stand by him thin and thick. They help man in forgetting his worries of life.</p>
  <p>Books enrich man's knowledge. They improve his ideas and help him built his character. Through books man comes to know about past ages.

But we should read good books only. Such books give us the treasure that cannot be stolen by anyone. We should be very careful about the selection of books. While making selection of books, we can take the help of our parents and teachers. </p>

 <span style="Color: Yellow">Value of Education</span>

 <article>
  <p>Education makes a person an efficient decision-maker and a right thinker. Moreover, this is possible only with the help of education. This is because education acquaints an individual with knowledge of the world around him and beyond, besides teaching the individual to be a better judge of the present.</p>
  <p>Education enables a person to access the open world. Furthermore, a person without education is unable to read and write. Consequently, a person without education would remain closed to all the knowledge and wisdom an educated person can gain from books and other mediums.</p>
  <p>Without education, a person would feel trapped. One can understand this by the example of a man who is confined to a closed room, completely shut from the outside world, with no way to exit it. Most noteworthy, an uneducated person can be compared to this confined man.</p>
  <p>The government is running various literacy programmes like the free-education program, weekend and part-time study program, continuing education program, mid-day meal program, adult literacy program, etc. With the consistent success rate of these programmes, hopefully, things will better.</p>
  <p>Education is one of the most effective ways to make people better and more productive. It is a tool that can make people easy to lead but at the same time difficult to drive. Education removes naivety and ignorance from the people, leaving them aware, informed, and enlightened.</p>

 <article>
 <p>Meeting and parting are two aspects of life. Meeting is full of excitement and new hopes. We except new things to happen and new relations to blossom in times to come. On the other hand, parting is painful. It saddens our heart. We feel as if we were going to lose the world. For the time being things look unbearable. This is what happens on our last day at school. </p> 
 <p>On the last day, the students of 10+1 and 10+2 assemble in a hall room. The students of 10+1 class give a farewell party to their seniors. The room is decorated with flowers and buntings. The function is presided over by the principal. Many other teachers are also invited. Their senior students are presented bouquets. All occupy their seats. One of the students acts as the stage secretary. </p> 
 <p>The students of the outgoing class recall good old days of school life. They admire the school principal and their teachers. They take pledges to not to forget their school wherever they may go in future. They also give piece of advice to the junior students to glorify the name of their students. Farewell songs are sung. Moving speeches are made. Tears really trickle down the eyes of sensitive students. </p> 
 <p>Finally the principal addresses the students. He advises them to uphold the traditions of the school. He wants them to remember the school and help it progress in times to come. He thanks them for having been good during their school-days. The students of the junior class give gifts to the parting students. Last of all there is a tea-party. The students leave for their homes with heavy hearts. </p>

 <span style="Color: Yellow">Why Worry have Faith in god</span>
 <article>
 <p>No matter how much you worry about a problem will your worries mind reach a solution?</p>
 <p>It is very unlikely. What will probably happen is that you will become upset and frustrated, the feeling of being heavy and burdened. Lose sleep, lose appetite, lose everything – probably all you will gain ulcer, a wrinkled brow and tension.</p>
 <p>Of course there are always those who feel they have more to do than everyone else, but the fact remains that life itself requires certain efforts to be made simply to remain alive.</p>
 <p>Some people make quite a hobby out of worry. They worry about the noise and then complain when it is too quiet. They worry about having too much sunny dry spells and then complain when rain. There are even people who are worried about worrying too much. We know it is essential to take an honest interest in what goes on around us and of course it is always wise to analyze a situation and take the necessary precautions so as to avoid being influenced by anything negative. However, when all is said and done my tense and burdened mind will be able to function clearly enough solution to a problem.</p>
 <p>I have always heard our loving sister Principal Jaslin saying “Offer yourself into the loving hands of almighty God”. This enables me to a peaceful mind. </p>
 <p>May be all you should promise yourself is to do the best that you can but if you find that even your best is not good enough, then why not you leave it in the hands of God. To have faith in the self, faith in God and faith in God`s plan is a sure way to remain clear and free of burdens.</p>
