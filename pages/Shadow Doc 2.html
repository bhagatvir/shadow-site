    <article>
 <p>There once lived a boy, Paul. He was a tall and calm-natured boy. But he was not good in studies. He always liked doing something else other than studies. Due to this, he was always got low marks in each subject. But upon getting the worst marks in the subject that his parents taught, he went into deep change. On the result day evening, he sat near a sea-shore</p>
 <p>He thought that why he was getting so low marks. But then a close friend of him, Ankit came near him and said, “Hi Paul how’s going?” He started to express his feelings. He also said, “Ankit, we both are friends, we both live in earth, we both eat, we both breathe, we both drink so why am I getting low marks but you are getting good marks. Ankit laughed loudly and said, “My friend tell me everything that you are feeling right now”</p>
 <p>As said Paul told everything. Ankit said, “Don’t worry it’s just a matter of time, soon your time will also come”. These words made Paul feel comfortable. But still Paul did not had his answer</p>
 <p>Paul again asked his question. Ankit said, “Ok, tell me what you do in class”. He said, “I Imagine of things”. “What things” Ankit asked. He told that he thinks of super-natural things like What-if I had super-powers like invisibility. He said, “An invisible person would not be stopped or checked by anybody. He could travel wherever he wishes to; he can tease anybody and peep anywhere.” He said, “He could acquire position, power, he could become one of the riches of the world”</p>
 <p>Ankit listened to Paul’s frustrations and then smiled, saying, “Your imagination is amazing, Paul. Maybe you’re not doing well because your mind is always exploring other possibilities. But think about it—if you had superpowers, like invisibility, wouldn’t you need to understand things like physics and biology to avoid detection? And if you wanted to become one of the richest, you’d need to know about finance and economics”</p>
 <p>Paul’s eyes lit up as he realized his studies could be tools for his dreams. He saw that each subject could bring him closer to achieving his goals. From that day on, he approached school with a new motivation, thinking of every lesson as a step toward the kind of future he imagined</p>

 <p>There once lived a boy named Bhagat who was passionate about football. He was tall, calm, and always helped his friends when they were stressed. Whether it was solving problems or offering a listening ear, Bhagat was always there for others. His calm and composed nature made him stand out among his peers. Football was his escape, the game that made him feel alive and confident. Bhagat excelled at it, earning praise from his teachers and friends. However, things at home weren’t as smooth</p>
 <p>At home, his parents constantly compared him to other students. They valued high grades above everything else and criticized Bhagat when his marks didn’t meet their expectations. Though he tried to explain how well he was doing in sports, especially football, his parents didn’t see the value in it. They believed focusing on academics was the only path to success. Despite his best efforts, Bhagat was caught in the middle of trying to please his parents and following his passion for football</p>
 <p>Eventually, his parents made a difficult decision. Seeing his grades slip slightly, they thought it would be best for Bhagat to quit football altogether. They assumed this would help him focus more on his studies. Bhagat was heartbroken. Football wasn’t just a sport to him; it was his escape from stress and a way to feel free. Without it, his enthusiasm for both school and life started to fade. His grades, instead of improving, got worse. He felt trapped, unable to express how he really felt to his parents</p>
 <p>As his grades continued to drop, the criticism from his parents grew louder. They blamed him for not focusing enough, but Bhagat knew it wasn’t that simple. He missed football, the one thing that made him feel like himself. But with no one listening to him, Bhagat became quieter, withdrawing from conversations about school or his future. He felt as though his voice didn’t matter anymore</p>
 <p>One day, after seeing how miserable Bhagat had become, his parents started to reconsider their decision. They realized that by taking away something he loved, they had unintentionally hurt him even more. They understood that success wasn’t only about grades but also about finding balance in life. Slowly, they began to listen to Bhagat, acknowledging his passion for football and how it positively affected him</p>
 <p>This realization changed everything. His parents allowed him to return to football, and Bhagat found his balance once again</p>
 <p>The moral of the story is that recognizing and nurturing a child's diverse talents is essential for their overall happiness and success</p>

The air was filled with the earthy scent of damp leaves, and the sun peeked through the thick canopy, casting dappled shadows on the forest floor</p>
 <p>Suddenly, a low growl broke the tranquil atmosphere. The friends turned to see a massive bear lumbering toward them, its fur glistening in the shafts of sunlight. Panic washed over Stark as he froze in place, while Farhan’s eyes darted around, seeking an escape. In a flash of cleverness, Farhan scrambled up the nearest tree, his heart racing, leaving Stark behind</p>
 <p>Desperate and without a plan, Stark lay flat on the ground, holding his breath, praying the bear wouldn't notice him. The bear approached, sniffing the air with its large, moist nose, its dark eyes glinting with curiosity. Stark's heart pounded in his chest as he felt the ground tremble beneath the bear's weight. To Stark's relief, the bear leaned closer, examining him with a sniff. Mistaking him for a lifeless body, it eventually turned and ambled away, leaving Stark shaken but unharmed</p>
 <p>After a tense moment, Farhan climbed down the tree, his heart still racing from the fear. Eager to know what had transpired, he asked Stark, “What did the bear say to you?”</p>  
 <p>With a heavy heart, Stark replied, “The bear warned me to beware of false friends.” Farhan felt a rush of shame flood over him, his face reddening as he realized the truth in Stark’s words. In that moment, the weight of his selfishness hung heavily in the air, more suffocating than the jungle around them</p>
 <p>From that day forward, Farhan knew he must change. The bond of friendship was too precious to betray</p>
